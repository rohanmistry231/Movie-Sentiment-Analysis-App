Welcome to **Movie Review Sentiment Analysis**, a web application that predicts the sentiment (positive or negative) of movie reviews using a deep learning model. Built with Streamlit and TensorFlow, this app leverages an LSTM model trained on the IMDB dataset to provide accurate sentiment predictions with confidence scores. Deployed on Streamlit Cloud, it's user-friendly and perfect for movie enthusiasts and developers alike! üé•

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- Streamlit Cloud account (for deployment)
- Jupyter Notebook (to run the training script)

### Local Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rohanmistry231/sentiment-analysis-app.git
   cd sentiment-analysis-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Create a virtual environment and install the required packages:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare Model Files**:
   The app requires `model.h5` and `tokenizer.pkl` to function. These files are generated by training the model using the provided Jupyter Notebook:
   - Open `IMDB_reviews_Sentiment_Analysis_LSTM.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Run all cells to train the LSTM model on the `IMDB_Dataset.csv` dataset.
   - The notebook will save `model.h5` (the trained model) and `tokenizer.pkl` (the tokenizer) in the project root.

   **Note**: If you already have pre-trained `model.h5` and `tokenizer.pkl` files, you can skip this step.

4. **Run the App Locally**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`.

## üåê Deploy on Streamlit Cloud

1. **Push to GitHub**:
   - Create a new repository on GitHub.
   - Push your project files:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Initial commit"
     git push origin main
     ```

2. **Set Up Streamlit Cloud**:
   - Log in to [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io).
   - Click "New App" and connect your GitHub repository.
   - Select the branch (e.g., `main`) and specify `app.py` as the main file.
   - Click "Deploy".

3. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Once deployed, Streamlit Cloud will provide a URL (e.g., `https://sentiment-analysis-app.streamlit.app`).
   - Open the URL to test the app.

**Note**: If `model.h5` is too large for GitHub, host it on Google Drive or AWS S3 and modify `app.py` to download it during runtime.

## üìñ Usage

1. **Navigate to the Home Page**:
   - Learn about the app's features and how to use it.

2. **Go to the Prediction Page**:
   - Use the sidebar to select "Prediction".
   - Enter a movie review in the text area.
   - Click "Analyze Sentiment" to get the prediction.

3. **Try Example Reviews**:
   - In the sidebar, click on "Example 1", "Example 2", or "Example 3" to test pre-loaded reviews.

4. **View and Download History**:
   - Expand the "View Analysis History" section to see past analyses.
   - Click "Download History" to save your analysis history as a Markdown file.

## üì¶ Dependencies

Listed in `requirements.txt`:
- `streamlit==1.39.0`
- `tensorflow==2.17.0`
- `numpy==1.26.4`
- `streamlit-option-menu==0.4.1`

For training the model (in the Jupyter Notebook), additional dependencies may be required, such as:
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `kaggle` (for downloading the dataset)

Install them with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the notebook, install additional dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn kaggle jupyter
```

## üìä Dataset

The dataset used for training the model is `IMDB_Dataset.csv`, which contains 50,000 movie reviews from the IMDB dataset. Each review is labeled as either "positive" or "negative". The dataset is balanced, with 25,000 reviews per class.

- **Source**: Originally sourced via the Kaggle API (as shown in the notebook).
- **Columns**:
  - `review`: The text of the movie review.
  - `sentiment`: The label (`positive` or `negative`).
- **Usage**: The dataset is used in `IMDB_reviews_Sentiment_Analysis_LSTM.ipynb` to train the LSTM model.

If you need to re-download the dataset, the notebook includes instructions for using the Kaggle API. You'll need a Kaggle account and API token (`kaggle.json`).

---

## üß† Model Details

- **Dataset**: IMDB dataset of 50k movie reviews (`IMDB_Dataset.csv`).
- **Model Architecture**: LSTM with an Embedding layer, trained using TensorFlow.
- **Training**: 5 epochs, batch size of 64, validation split of 0.2.
- **Preprocessing**: Tokenized and padded reviews to a maximum length of 200, using a vocabulary of 5000 words.

The model and tokenizer are saved as `model.h5` and `tokenizer.pkl`, respectively.

---

## üìú Model Training

The `IMDB_reviews_Sentiment_Analysis_LSTM.ipynb` notebook contains the complete workflow for training the sentiment analysis model. It includes:

- **Data Collection**: Downloads the IMDB dataset using the Kaggle API.
- **Preprocessing**: Tokenizes and pads the reviews, converts labels to binary (0 for negative, 1 for positive).
- **Model Building**: Defines an LSTM model with an Embedding layer and Dense output.
- **Training**: Trains the model for 5 epochs with validation.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluates the model on a test set.
- **Saving**: Saves the trained model as `model.h5` and the tokenizer as `tokenizer.pkl`.

### Running the Notebook
1. Install Jupyter Notebook and dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter pandas scikit-learn kaggle tensorflow
   ```
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Open `IMDB_reviews_Sentiment_Analysis_LSTM.ipynb` and run all cells.
4. Ensure `kaggle.json` is set up for downloading the dataset (instructions in the notebook).
